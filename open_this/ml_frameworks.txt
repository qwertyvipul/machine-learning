1. Apache Singa - This is a deep learning framework used extensively for natural language processing and image recognition.

2. Apache Spark MLlib - This is the Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library and is now part of the Spark ecosystem of products. The main benefit of this framework is that it learns extremely fast from data.

3. Caffe - You use Caffe when expression, speed and, modularity are the prime considerations for a deep learning frameworks to use for vision tasks and generally learning from images, thanks to its pretrained CaffeNet neural network. (You can process 600 million images a day using a single GPU).

4. Google TensorFlow - This framework relies on data flow graphics that define how a series of deep learning algorithms process data batches (tensors). The graphs trace the flows (movements) of data throught the system. You can use this framework for complex data processing using C++ or Python on CPUs or GPUs. The main disadvantage of this framework are that it requires a lot of processing power and a strong knowledge of neural networks. The advantages are that it can handle even complex machine learning problems, and modifying the flows to test different solutions is reatively easy.

5. Oxdata H2O - These libraries offer prepackaged routines that you can use to perform machine learning tasks. The H2O library algorithms specifically geared to meet business needs. It can directly access any Hadoop Distributed File Store(HDFS) using Java, Python, R and Scala.

6. Nervana Neon - Neon is an example of a framework that can use CPUs, GPUs, or the custom Nervana hardware to perform machine learning tasks. The main disadvantage is that it does have a higher-than-usual learning curve.

7. Shogun - One of the oldest and most common libraries is Shogun. You can use it with all sorts of languages: C++, Java, Python, C#, Ruby, Lua, Octave, and Matlab.
