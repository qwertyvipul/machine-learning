# Learning in the Age of Big Data

Data is hidden in plain view today. It can come from any source, even your email.
For instance, consider the gmail's feature of possible responses canned at the bottom of your mail.<br/>

Watch this [video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/the-master-algorithm-how-the-quest-for-the-ultimate-learning-machine-will-remake-our-world/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fapps%2Fvideo%2Fdefault.aspx%3Fid%3D256288)
to gain insight of the some of the modern and unknown machine learning applications in developement.<br/>

## Role of statistics in Machine Learning - 
Statistics represent one of the five _tribes_ (schools of thoughts) that makes machine learning feasible - 
```markdown
1. Symoblists - The origin of this tribe is in logic and philosophy. This group relies on inverse deduction to solve problems.
2. Connectionists - The origin of this tribe is in neuroscience. This group relies on backpropagation to solve problems.
3. Evolutionaries - The origin of this tribe is in evolutionary biology. This group relies on genetic programming to solve problems.
4. Bayesians - This origin of this tribe is in statistics. This group relies on probabilistic inference to solve problems.
5. Analogizers - The origin of this tribe is in psychology. This group relies on kernel machines to solve problems.
```

The ultimate goal of machine learning is to combine the technologies and strategies embraced by the five tribes 
to create a single algorithm (the master algorithm) that can learn anything.<br/>

The secret to machine learning is generalization - A learner algorithm relies on just three algorithms to generalize the machine learning model.
```
1. Representation
2. Evalutaion
3. Optimization
```
