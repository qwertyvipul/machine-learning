# Getting Started

**Learning vs Intelligence**<br/>
The computer getting better and better at doing its job is learning. 
Whereas, it not being aware of its job or the consequences is the lack of Intelligence.

**A true AI can occur when computer can emulate the clever combinations used by the nature.**<br/>
```markdown
1. Genetics - Slow learning from one generation to the next.
2. Teaching - Fast learning from organized sources.
3. Exploration - Spontaneous learning from media and interaction with others.
```

## Things to mind during developing a machine learning model - 
1. Obtaining useful results
2. Asking the right question
3. Relying on Intution

## Some uses of AI - 
1. Fraud Detection
2. Resource Scheduling
3. Complex Analysis
4. Automation
5. Customer Service
6. Safety Systems
7. Machine Efficiency
8. Access Controls
9. Animal Protection
10. Predicting wait times

## Relationship between AI and Machine Learning -
```
Machine learning is part of what a system requires to become an AI. It enables an AI to - 
1. Adapt to new circumstances that original developer didn't envision.
2. Detect patterns in all sorts of data sources.
3. Create new behaviours based on recognized patterns.
4. Make decisions based on the success or failure of these behaviours.
